/**
 * Detect when the current user has been removed from the active namespace
 * by an admin and bounce them out of the workspace.
 *
 * Why: the server cascades `MemberRemoved` (strips ContextIdentity rows,
 * adds the user to the namespace deny-list) but the curb UI has no SSE
 * channel for governance ops, so a removed user keeps seeing their stale
 * sidebar until they refresh. This poll closes that gap.
 *
 * How: we call `resolveCurrentMemberIdentity(groupId, "")` — pass empty
 * stored identity so the API does NOT fall back to the cached value when
 * `listMembers` returns 405 on older merods (that fallback path is meant
 * for "workspace entry on older nodes" and would mask a real removal).
 * After the first successful resolution we mark `everHadIdentity = true`;
 * a subsequent 404 from that point means the server has cascaded us out.
 *
 * On transient errors (any non-404), we do nothing — we'd rather miss a
 * tick than redirect on a flaky network.
