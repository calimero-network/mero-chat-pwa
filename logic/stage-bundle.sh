#!/usr/bin/env bash
# logic/stage-bundle.sh — build the dev bundle and stage it at a fixed path.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Every `workflows/*.yml` scenario installs the app with
# `type: install_application, dev: true`. Until rc.41 that step was handed
# `../logic/res/curb.wasm` — the raw module — and the node took it.
#
# It does not any more. `install_application_from_path` (core
# crates/node/primitives/.../application/install.rs) now reads the file and
# refuses anything that is not a signed bundle:
#
#     not a signed application bundle: /.../curb.wasm
#
# surfacing through merobox as a bare 500 on the install step, which reads like
# a node problem rather than a payload problem. The id also derives from the
# manifest's (package, signer) pair, so a payload without a manifest has no
# re-derivable application id — there is nothing for the node to fall back to.
#
# WHY NOT JUST NAME THE .mpk IN THE SCENARIOS
#
# `cargo mero bundle` writes `dist/<package>-<version>.mpk`, so the filename
# carries `[package] version` from Cargo.toml. Naming it in five scenario files
# means a version bump silently breaks all five, and the breakage only shows up
# in a 45-minute CI job. `--print-output-path` is the supported way to ask where
# it landed, so ask, and copy it somewhere the scenarios can hard-code.
#
# The staged copy is `dist/curb.mpk`. `dist/` is gitignored, so this runs in CI
# (both merobox workflows) and in scripts/setup-nodes.sh before any scenario.
#
# Usage:  ./stage-bundle.sh          # dev key, for local + CI scenarios
